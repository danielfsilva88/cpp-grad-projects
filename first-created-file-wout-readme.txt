github page "repository" just shows the options to import code from pc or another site if you didn't create a readme file

also it gives the option to create a readme, gitignore or a license file... so, a clicked in "create readme file" and here i am now.

i'm testing create a file in this way, by changing the name of this file from pre-conceived "README.md" 
to "first-created-file-wout-readme.txt"

cheers!
